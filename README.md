# deleteAllTweets
A simple JS file to delete all your tweets / replies (not retweets / shares).

Just login to your twitter account in your web browser and go to the tab (Tweets / Tweets & replies / Media) that you want to clear, paste the code from the JS file to the browser console and hit enter.

Time taken to delete your tweets will depend on the volume of your tweets.

You can also save the JS file as a bookmark and just run it with a click.
